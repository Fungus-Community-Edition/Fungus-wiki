<h1 id="luaenvironment">LuaEnvironment</h1>
<p>The LuaEnvironment component manages all the variables, functions, executing code, etc. for a single Lua context, and provides handy functions for loading and running Lua scripts. In order to run Lua code there must be at least one LuaEnvironment component present in the scene. </p>
<p>You can create one via (Tools &gt; Fungus &gt; Create &gt; LuaEnvironment). You usually don&#39;t need to explicitly create a LuaEnvironment though because FungusLua will create one automatically when there isn&#39;t one in the scene at startup.</p>

<h1 id="multiple-environments">Multiple Environments</h1>
<p>You can use multiple LuaEnvironments in your scene to ’sandbox’ the variables, functions and executing code of independent sets of Lua scripts. If you do this, make sure to specify the appropriate LuaEnvironment when using LuaScript components, ExecuteLua commands, etc. or else they&#39;ll just use the first one they find in the scene.</p>
<h1 id="vs-code-debugger">VS Code Debugger</h1>
<p>VS Code is a free open source IDE from Microsoft which you can use to write code for Unity projects. FungusLua automatically starts a VS Code debug server when in playmode in the Unity Editor. See the <a href="http://www.moonsharp.org/debugger.html">MoonSharp documentation</a> for how to configure VS Code to debug Lua scripts. Note that the game has to be running in the Unity Editor before you can connect the VS Code debugger to it.</p>
<p>The &#39;Remote Debugger&#39; option activates the built-in MoonSharp remote debugger tool. The application will halt execution on the first executed line of Lua code and open a MoonSharp debugger window in your browser. See the <a href="http://www.moonsharp.org/debugger.html">MoonSharp documentation</a> for more information on using this debugger.</p>
<h1 id="luautils">LuaUtils</h1>
<p>When you create a LuaEnvironment object via (Tools &gt; Fungus &gt; Create &gt; LuaEnvironment), the created gameobject has another component called LuaUtils which adds many useful features to the basic LuaEnvironment setup. See the [[Lua Utils|lua_utils]] section for more info.</p>

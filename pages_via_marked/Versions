<p>In general, Fungus is being maintained for the most recent publicly released version of Unity. You can confirm the version of Unity currently being used to maintain Fungus <a href="https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/blob/master/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt">here</a> and can safely assume the most recent released version of Fungus has had the most testing with that version.</p>
<p>In the release section you will also see a package labelled Compatibility, with a named older version of Unity, probably an LTS. These releases have minor changes to ensure ease of installation on older versions of Unity. For example Fungus 3.12 Compat does not use asmdefs.</p>
<p>In cases where alterations were required for Fungus to function correctly on older versions of Unity, these will be called out in the release section. </p>
<p>It is also worth checking the <a href="https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/branches">branches</a> to see if there is a version listed there. If you find issues with a version that has a branch there; bug fix PRs against those branches is welcomed. Also remember to ask questions and seek help in the forum.</p>
<p>If you are seeking support for a specific older version of Unity, check out the <a href="https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/releases">Releases</a> matching your Unity versions release date with a Fungus release date is a good bet.</p>

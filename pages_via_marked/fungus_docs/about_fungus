<h1 id="whos-it-for">Who&#39;s it for?</h1>
<p>Fungus is for writers, illustrators, animators and game designers, especially visual novel &amp; interactive fiction authors. Many people using Fungus are creating games in Unity for the very first time. It is a popular choice for game jams and game design courses.</p>
<h1 id="free--open-source">Free &amp; Open Source</h1>
<p>We believe that interactive storytelling should be accessible to everyone, so Fungus is <b>100% free &amp; open source</b>. It works great with both the free and pro versions of Unity 3D. Fungus is inspired by other great open source storytelling tools like <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine</a>, <a href="https://www.renpy.org">Ren&#39;Py</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.</p>
<h1 id="community">Community</h1>
<p>The Fungus community is very welcoming and helpful to newcomers. Many people using Fungus have never used Unity or even made a game before, so feel free to ask questions on our <a href="http://fungusgames.com/forum">community forum</a>. Helping other people with their questions is a fantastic and very welcome way to contribute back to the community.</p>

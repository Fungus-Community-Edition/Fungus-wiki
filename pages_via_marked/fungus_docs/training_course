<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>We&#39;ve teamed up with Paul Mc Grath to create an extensive <a href="http://fungusgames.com/udemy">Udemy training course</a> which teaches how to make storytelling games using Fungus and Unity. Sales of this course help us to continue developing Fungus, so it&#39;s a nice way to learn Fungus and to support the work we&#39;re doing on the project.</p>
<p><a href="http://fungusgames.com/udemy">Udemy training course</a></p>
<p>This course is aimed at anyone who wants to make interactive story based games, but, who doesn&#39;t know how to code.</p>
<p>Fungus is a free Unity 3D plugin that allows non coders (like Paul) access to some of Unity&#39;s core features. If you have never used game development software, or if you have struggled with code trying to make games, Fungus and this course are exactly what you need.</p>

<h1 id="flowcharts">Flowcharts</h1>
<p>A fundamental concept of Fungus is the <strong>Flowchart</strong>. Scenes can contain a single Flowchart or multiple Flowcharts.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-flowchart">What is a Flowchart?</h1>
<p>A Fungus <strong>Flowchart</strong> contains the Blocks in which all your Fungus Commands are located. A Unity scene can contain multiple Flowcharts, and commands can be executing simultaneously in different Flowcharts. However, for many games it is sufficient for one Block in one Flowcart to be executing at any one time.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a Fungus Flowchart:</p>

<h1 id="the-flowchart-window">The Flowchart window</h1>
<p>You&#39;ll need the Fungus Flowchart window when working with Fungus. Open and dock this window somewhere handy by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose menu: <code>Tools | Fungus | Flowchart Window</code></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Drag-and-drop the Flowchart window to the location you wish to dock it:</li>
</ol>

<li>The Flowchart window is now docked and part of your Unity window layout:</li>

<h1 id="creating-a-flowchart">Creating a Flowchart</h1>
<p>To create a Fungus Flowchart do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose menu: <code>Tools | Fungus | Create Flowchart</code></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/raw/master/Docs/resources/flowcharts/005_create_flowchart/1_tools_create.png" alt="menu create Flowchart" title="menu create Flowchart"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>A new <strong>Flowchart</strong> gameObject should appear in the Hierarchy window.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/raw/master/Docs/resources/flowcharts/005_create_flowchart/2_flowchart_gameobject.png" alt="new Flowchart gameobject" title="new Flowchart gameobject"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select the <strong>Flowchart</strong> gameObject in the Hierarchy window, and you&#39;ll see the <strong>Flowchart&#39;s</strong> properties in the Inspector Window:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/raw/master/Docs/resources/flowcharts/005_create_flowchart/3_flowchart_properties.png" alt="Flowchart properties" title="Flowchart properties"></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>If you have not already displayed the Flowchart Window, you can do so by clicking the Flowchart Window button in the Inspector.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As you can see, when a new Flowchat is created a single command Block named &quot;New Block&quot; is automatically created, with the Event handler &quot;Game Started&quot; (so it will start executing Fungus commands as soon as the scene goes into <strong>Play Mode</strong>).</p>
</li>
</ol>

# Fungus Training Course

# Course Description

We've teamed up with Paul Mc Grath to create an extensive [Udemy training course] which teaches how to make storytelling games using Fungus and Unity. Sales of this course help us to continue developing Fungus, so it's a nice way to learn Fungus and to support the work we're doing on the project.

[Udemy training course]

This course is aimed at anyone who wants to make interactive story based games, but, who doesn't know how to code.

Fungus is a free Unity 3D plugin that allows non coders (like Paul) access to some of Unity's core features. If you have never used game development software, or if you have struggled with code trying to make games, Fungus and this course are exactly what you need.

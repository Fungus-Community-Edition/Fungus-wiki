Fungus
======

Fungus is a free, open source tool for creating interactive storytelling games in Unity 3D. Fungus is designed to be easy to learn for beginners to Unity 3D, especially for people with no coding experience. 

For more experienced users, it provides an intuitive, fast workflow for visual scripting and interactive storytelling. Fungus is being used to create Visual Novels, Point and Click Adventure Games, Childrens Stories, Hidden Object Games, eLearning apps and also some frankly weird stuff which defies classification :)

If you make something cool with Fungus, PLEASE let us know about it so we can add it to the [Games gallery](http://fungusgames.com/games).
